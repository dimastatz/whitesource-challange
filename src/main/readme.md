By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.


   3
  7 4
 2 4 6
8 5 9 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

   3
  7 4
 2 4 6
8 5 9 3

Your mission is to find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt (see attached), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

Please send the solution back by XXXX, so we can move quickly with our process together.

This should be a Java code solution - a Main class that we can run and view the result. 
There can be as many other classes as you see fit, but please send all the .java files. 
Code readability and structure will be evaluated as well.

For any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
Good Luck!
